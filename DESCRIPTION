Description: Implements SADA (safe and adaptive aggregation) methods for
    semi-supervised learning with multiple black-box outcome predictions.
    The package provides estimators for the marginal outcome mean and for
    linear regression coefficients that combine labeled outcomes, unlabeled
    covariates and several prediction models in a provably safe and adaptive
    way. Functions return point estimates, standard errors, confidence
    intervals and optimal aggregation weights, and are designed to be easy
    to use in both simulation studies and applied data analyses. Methods are
    based on the paper "Safe and Adaptive Aggregation of Multiple Black-Box
    Predictions in Semi-Supervised Learning" (<arXiv:2509.21707>).
